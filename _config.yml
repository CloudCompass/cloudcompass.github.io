stream optimizations, integrating Development and Operations teams (DevOps), and
creating continuous improvement cultures for more than 15 years. We have been
contributing to the Linux Foundationâ€™s Hyperledger Indy and Aries projects for

(SSI), decentralized identifiers (DIDs), verifiable credentials (VCs) and the
blockchain technologies that will drive the next major wave of Internet
innovation."
