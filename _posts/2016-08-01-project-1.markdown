description: The BC Dev Exchange is an initiative to find better ways government and developers to work together. The government provides easier access to opportunities so it gets better solutions, and developers create great solutions that work for the government and can be deployed elsewhere. C3I has been around from the early days of the Dev Exchange, including playing a hands on role in the Container Management Platform technology that enables the BC Dev Exchange program.
