                    <p class="text-muted">We have been working with, and
                    contributing to the Linux Foundation’s Hyperledger Indy and
                    Aries projects for more than two years. In that work, we've
                    dug deeply into self-sovereign identity (SSI), decentralized
                    identifiers (DIDs), verifiable credentials (VCs) and the
                    blockchain foundation that will drive the next major wave of
                    Internet innovation. Want help with understanding
                    decentralized identity/verifiable credentials and whether
                    your organization should be getting involved (spoiler alert -
                    you should!)? We can help you understand the space, if you
                    should be using the technology and if so, how you can get
                    started.

                    <p class="text-muted">We've been implementing end-to-end
                    value stream optimizations, integrating Development and
                    Operations teams (DevOps), and creating continuous
                    improvement cultures for more than 15 years. We provide
                    customized (and open source) training to help your team
                    align on what is to be expected from a DevOps
                    transformation. We'll work with you to create and execute an
                    agile plan to iteratively and openly carry out your
                    transformation to an effective DevOps culture—giving you
                    agility and expanded delivery capabilities.

                    <p class="text-muted">We offer consulting, training and technical writing for identity using blockchain solutions and DevOps. In both domains, we anchor our services around two courses for getting started:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="text-muted">“Get-Up-to-Speed Quickly”: A half- to one-day course,
                            taught at a business-level.</li>                        
                        <li class="text-muted">“Deep-Dive for Developers”: A one- to two-day course, 
                            taught at a more technical level with lots of hands-on labs and demos.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="text-muted">Both courses are intended to be customized and extended
                        to kick off discussions and planning for your specific use cases.</p>
                    <p class="text-muted">Want a sample of what we can do?
                        We created the Linux Foundation's course on
                        Hyperledger Aries, Indy and Ursa.
