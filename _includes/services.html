                        integrating Dev and Ops teams, and creating continuous improvement cultures. We provide customized (and Open Source) training
                        to help your team align on what is to be expected from a DevOps transformation. We'll work with you to create and execute an agile plan to
                        iteratively and openly carry out your transformation to an effective DevOps culture - giving you agility and expanded delivery capabilities.

                        development and delivery, container orchestration using Kubernetes and deploying and using a container managed platform. If you are struggling to modernize your

                    <p class="text-muted">We have been working with, and contributing to the Hyperledger Indy project (part of the Linux Foundation) for more than a year. In that work, we've
                        dug deeply into Internet Identity, Decentralized Identifiers, Verifiable Credentials and the blockchain foundation that will drive the next major
                        wave of Internet innovation. Want help with understanding blockchain and whether your organization should be getting involved?  We can help you understand the space,
                        if you should be using the technology and if so, how you can get started.
